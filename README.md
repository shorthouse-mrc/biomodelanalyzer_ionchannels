# biomodelanalyzer_ionchannels
A repository for biomodelanalyzer models relating to ion channels in cancer associated systems.

# Using these models
To use these models they need to be loaded into the publically available biomodelanalyzer tool (www.biomodelanalyzer.org). Load the model by downloading it, then using the "import" function to load the .json. You can then explore the model using stability analysis, simulations, and LTL (linear temporal logic). For advice on how to use these tools please see our other publications, or the help section of the biomodelanalyzer website.

For details on how these models were derived, and their relevance, please see the original publication.
